## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following analyses:

- Data Exploration
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Residual Analysis
- Outlier Detection and Handling
- Feature Visualization

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to install the following packages:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn statsmodels matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy
```
## Data Visualization
A key aspect of this project is the use of advanced visualization techniques to understand the data's structure and relationships. Scatter plots, histograms, residual plots, and more are utilized.

## Predictive Modeling
We employ Linear Regression, a robust statistical modeling technique, to predict median housing prices based on various features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc.
